*This document covers the Deployment and Execution of the Sort-Of Application, Where to find the deployed application after execution and how to test applications features*

 How To Deploy and Execute Sort-Of
 1. Clone the master branch of the github repo to your local code editor (using Github Desktop or "git clone -b master https://github.com/ShaimaaAliECE/se3350_project-group-3.git")
 2. Run the "npm install" command in the terminal to install all the required dependencies
 3. Next enter "expo start" in the terminal to execute and deploy the server
 4. Follow the link in the terminal "Developer tools running on http://localhost:xxxx" or scan the QR code to run the application on a mobile device (You need the expo app on your mobile phone to run Sort-Of on it)
 5. On the Developer tools page select "Run in web browser" or an alternative method if you want to test it on another device. This should start the application!
 
 How To Test the Sort-Of Application (Release 1)
 1. Once the Application is open the main menu should appear. From here select Merge Sort Algorithm.
 2. A list of levels should appear. The levels avaliable to test include levels 1, 2 and 3. Please note levels 4 and 5 are unavaliable for this release.
 3. On the level page a couple options are avaliable. The first level only has two menu options one to return to the home page and another to go to level 2.
 4. The second level has the same options as level 1 except the user is to enter the values for the next step in the algorithm. 
    Additionally 2 more menu options are avaliable, one to check for feedback on the answer and another depicted as a question mark which repeats the instructions for the current step.
 5. The third level has different options from the previous two. Here the user is required to fill in the empty circles to show how the list is split or merged.
    A space of any length between circles indicates a split in the array. The number selection is similar to that of level 2. As for the menu options the check answer button is used to check both the split/merge as well as the number inputs.
